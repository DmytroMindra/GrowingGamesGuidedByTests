The project from my ACCU conference talk.

This tutorial uses Unity Test Tools to arrange integration tests and is compatible with Unity 4.3+.

###How to use this tutorial?
* Navigate to Assets/Scenes

* Run the integration tests
* See them fail
* Fix the tests
* Run the tests and them succeed
* Open The Game.unity and lunch the game to see your progress :)
* Proceed to level 2 :)

Hint:
